This a demonstration of **Google's Antigravity**, an **AI agent-first development application** designed to offer a unified coding experience by integrating the functions of an **Integrated Development Environment (IDE)**, terminal, and browser. Antigravity aims to allow developers to start projects with **goals rather than code**, employing **AI agents** to manage complex, asynchronous workflows, research, and coding tasks. The document uses the creation of a **chess game with an AI opponent** as a case study to illustrate Antigravity's capabilities, detailing how the platform breaks the project down into **planning, core logic, UI/UX, and verification** artifacts through **natural language prompts**. Furthermore, it shows the agent iterating on the initial design to add **customization features** like different color themes and piece skins, demonstrating its ability to handle iterative software development and user interface improvements based on feedback.
